# Covid19-Insights
Having a dataset about Covid-19 and creating a Tableau Dashboard to present the infection rate, information about deaths and vaccinations. Skills used are Excel, cleaning of data, MySql queries and Tableau

<h3>Insights:</h3> 

The dataset used was across two csv files (covid_deaths.csv and covid_vaccinations.csv) and there was minimal cleaning needed. The integrity of the data is great except that it is incomplete data.
The datas range is from 2020/01/01-2021/04/30. Making the data incomplete and hard to run any analysis about covid in 2023.

<h6>Covid-Vaccinations.csv</h6>

MySql was used to create 6 unique csv files to be used for tableau. The queries made were made to mainly looked at percentages (death and vaccinations) as well as a count of the vaccinations and deaths across countries and continents.

<h6>SQl Queries</h6>

The final Tableau dashboard was reconstructed 3 times, as this was only my second Tableau project. The aim behind the dashboard was to keep it minimal in style and colour.

<h3>Conclusion:</h3> 
From the data we can determine that both Europe and North America had a much higher infection rate ( USA 9.5% infected) and an increase in deaths. 
The issue with the data given is that it is incomplete and we have no insurance that the integrity of the data has been uphold by each country. There may be missing inputs from certain countries, either through the lack of infrastructure or the records where not kept up to date with new cases each day.
